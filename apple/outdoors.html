						Make learning to catch easier by gently swinging a suspended ball into a child's arms.  All you need is a balloon and a pair of pantyhose.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Blow up the balloon until it fits snugly in the large part of the pantyhose.
						</li>
						<li>
							Tie off the top of the hose to prevent balloon pieces from escaping if the balloon pops.
						</li>
						<li>
							Hold the two toes of the hose in one hand so the balloon is off the floor.
						</li>
						<li>
							Gently swing the balloon toward the child until s/he grasps it. Or suspend the hose from a tree branch or doorknob so the child can push the balloon and catch it as it returns.
						</li>
						<li>
							For toddlers, lower the ball slowly into the child's outstretched arms until s/he becomes familiar with grasping the balloon.

							Scatter children in pairs throughout an activity area.

							Designate one partner as leader and the other as follower.

						<li>
							On "Go" followers stick like glue to their partner, moving closely behind them without touching. Try using music and start it on "Go."
						</li>
						<li>
							Prompt leaders to use a variety of movements (skipping, hopping, sliding, bending, etc.) and challenge followers to match their partner's movements.

						<li>
							After 20 seconds, signal leaders to freeze &mdash; stop the music if you are using it.

							Leaders stop and lead the partner in a stretch of their choice for 10 seconds.

							Reverse roles and repeat. Adults should join in too!
