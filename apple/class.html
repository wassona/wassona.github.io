					Morning Greetings
				</h3>
				<div class="modal-body">
					<p>
						Use Active Songs to start the day &mdash; making up your own tune or rhythm. Help children of all ages "get their wiggles out" and be ready to listen and follow directions.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="extra-bold">Example: Play the Alphabet Name Game</span> calling each child and caregiver by name: 
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="italics">Good morning (name). (name) starts with (first letter of name). Let's use our bodies to make that letter.</span> 
						</li>
						<li>
							Adults should play too!
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Younger children will catch on with practice. Find more ideas in the <a href="">Healthy Apple Physical Activity Toolkit</a>.

					Circle Time
				</h3>
				<div class="modal-body">
					<p>
						Circle time becomes 15-20 minutes of structured activity with a few simple props and ideas, such as a <span class="italics">Movement Jar</span>.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Print a list of exercises, games, movements. Cut them up and put them in a jar &mdash; jump like a kangaroo, balance on one foot, and so on. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Children take turns picking from the jar for the activity the group will do next.
						</li>
						<li>
							Adults should play, too.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Align the activity with concepts you are working on like counting ("hop 5 times") or days of the week (use a different activity for each day of the week).

				<h3 class="modal-title">
					Meal/Snack Time 
				</h3>
				<div class="modal-body">
					<p>
						Meal/snack time is a great opportunity to make connections between healthy foods and healthy bodies. It's a chance to incorporate physical activity. Motivate children to eat foods that will make them jump higher, grow taller and run faster. 
					</p>
					<p class="italics">
						Try this idea: 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A provider identifies each of the items (or ingredients) in the meal/snack. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Kids stand up each time foods of a certain color/food group/starting letter are called.
						</li>

			<div class="modal modal--transitions">
				<h3 class="modal-title">
					Transitions
				</h3>
				<div class="modal-body">
					<p>
						Take advantage of the transition of changing from one activity to the next by incorporating more movement &mdash; like directing the children to follow a leader's movements, act like animals or do exercises (jump, hop, skip, arm circles).  Tailor the activity to the age group.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							For younger children, assign a specific song or movement for each type of transition to help them learn a new routine (example: walk like a monkey).  
						</li>
						<li>
							Older children love more surprises with their structure (example: they may know that they act like an animal each time they go outside but won't know which one until the provider calls it out). 
						</li>
					</ul>

			<div class="modal modal--nap">
				<h3 class="modal-title">
					Nap Time
				</h3>
				<div class="modal-body">
					<p>
						Before and after nap time is time for slow movement &mdash; to develop balance and stretch muscles to prepare for the transition to/from rest.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Put on calm music and join the kids in doing slow stretches or walks to their cots/blankets.
						</li>
						<li>
							Have them lay down in slow motion.
						</li>
